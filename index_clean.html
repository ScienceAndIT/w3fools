                A few of us JavaScript developers have been collecting cases where w3schools.com contains inaccurate information or just really
                bad advice. We certainly do not advocate that anyone use w3schools as a reference or place to learn techniques.The Mozilla Docs
                Center (MDC) is much much better<sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup>. It is also a wiki (little known fact),
                which means we, as knowledgeable web developers, can add or change information so the pages are as effective as possible.

                just append mdc to your search query.

                        This is a bullshit page. Why? you <strong>never</strong> pass a string to <code>setTimeout()</code> unless you like using
                        <code>eval()</code>. Doing this also means you can&#39;t use any variables from your local scope. Also, the examples on this page
                        has a ton of global variables.

                    <p>
                        Also abysmal. <code>document.write()</code> has a tendency to trash a page and is one of the poorest ways possible to add content. It
                        also means that you can&rsquo;t defer/asynchronously load a script and your DOM loading is delayed because the browser has to wait
                        for your <code>document.write()</code>. Oh, and by the way, user-agent sniffing is a <em>very</em> bad thing. So is sniffing just
                        about any parts of the <code>window.navigator</code> object.
