                A few of us JavaScript developers have been collecting cases where w3schools.com contains inaccurate information or just really
                bad advice. We certainly do not advocate that anyone use w3schools as a reference or place to learn techniques.The Mozilla Docs
                Center (MDC) is much much better<sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup>. It is also a wiki (little known fact),
                which means we, as knowledgeable web developers, can add or change information so the pages are as effective as possible.

                        This is a bullshit page. Why? you <strong>never</strong> pass a string to <code>setTimeout()</code> unless you like using
                        <code>eval()</code>. Doing this also means you can&#39;t use any variables from your local scope. Also, the examples on this page
                        has a ton of global variables.

                    <p>
                        Also abysmal. <code>document.write()</code> has a tendency to trash a page and is one of the poorest ways possible to add content. It
                        also means that you can&rsquo;t defer/asynchronously load a script and your DOM loading is delayed because the browser has to wait
                        for your <code>document.write()</code>. Oh, and by the way, user-agent sniffing is a <em>very</em> bad thing. So is sniffing just
                        about any parts of the <code>window.navigator</code> object.

                        avoid legal conflicts with the trademark owner. Similarly, Microsoft named its clone of JavaScript, JScript. Meanwhile, JavaScriptCore,

                        Assigning an <code>RegExp</code> object to a variable named <code>txt</code> is quite confusing. Also, weren&rsquo;t octals removed for
                        escape sequences in ES5? Also also, no mention of non-capturing submatches.

As for the examples linked to from that page, there&rsquo;s no good reason to refer to the SVG DTD. Who knows why that have standalone=&rdquo;no&rdquo; in the XML declaration when the document has no external references. Putting version=&rdquo;1.1&rdquo; on the root is kinda useless too.

                       What an exceptionally useful page... The &quot;tip&rdquo; that you can use multiple filters on an element is kind of misleading, if you happened to know how to write filters (because that list of elements sure doesn&rsquo;t help you): an element can have only one filter, but that filter might use multiple filter primitives to define its effect. The three lighting elements feDistantLight, fePointLight and feSpotLight aren&rsquo;t even filters primitives -- they&rsquo;re just helper elements for the two lighting primitives feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting.

                       The sentence talking about the id attribute on the &lt;filter&gt; is confused. &lt;filter&gt; need not be nested in a &lt;defs&gt;. The description of &lt;defs&gt; is pretty weak.

                        The docs on the HTML5 &lt;details&gt; element is written to make it sound like its a document-level metadata tag, when in fact its meant to hide and show further details of inline content. The page isn&rsquo;t written very well.

                        Encouraging the use of inline event handlers. &nbsp;the wise bot-t once said:

                    <blockquote>
                        Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren&#39;t reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can&#39;t normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.

<p>- I&rsquo;ve (Paul Irish) talked to the W3C to ask them to disavow a connection (since everyone thinks they are related) </p>

<p> &nbsp;- they are not interested in stating for a fact that they are not connected to the W3C </p>

<hr><p>anon 109 agrees. line breaks are cool if you need them, at least until some of the more advanced text wrapping stuff happens. of course, most people don&rsquo;t need them.</p>

<hr><p>strict equality is usually faster and avoids incorrect falsy evaluation.</p>
<hr><p>antimatter15 hasn&rsquo;t read JavaScript: The Good Parts :( I believe the main argument Crockford makes is that strict equality is often what people (particularly coming from backend backgrounds) actually expect, when they use ==</p>
<p>Well, either that or I&rsquo;m completely misinterpreting the comment too broadly :P</p>
<p>Also, IIRC isn&rsquo;t FF currently the oddball in that strict comparison is slower in it?</p>
