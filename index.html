              W3schools should consider <abbr title="make the site a wiki. Or.. put it all in public source control, like on Github.">wikifying</abbr> their content so the community would self correct and keep the information
              up-to-date. Today, they do not even allow you to submit corrections on a page. They should.

                      <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are called "methods," rather than objects that implement the HTML5
                      Storage interface. Nothing about their properties and methods are mentioned, it just shows a simple dot syntax getter example. &gt;:|
                      And this "content" is certainly not as old as other pages'.

                      The <code>hidden</code> attribute is a boolean attribute, which means that its presence defines the (true) value. There is no such thing as the <code>subject</code> attribute. Instead of listing all five microdata attributes, let's only list two and neglect to explain how they should be used - leaving the visitor clueless. Oh, and <code>dir</code> and <code>dropzone</code> are missing too.

                      The language was eventually standardized under the creative name ECMAScript by the EMCA international standards organization to
                      avoid legal conflicts with the trademark owner. Similarly, Microsoft named its clone of JavaScript, JScript. Meanwhile, JavaScriptCore,
                      the implementation of ECMAScript in Apple's Safari, appears to be willing to take the chance, and Google's v8 is off
                      doing its own thing being awesome and breaking the mold, man. Also, JavaScript is a subset (or superset depending upon which version

                      It's bad advice to suggest using the Adobe SVG Viewer for browser that don't support SVG. It's unmaintained and I think it
                      doesn't even work on Windows 7. Better is to suggest the use of SVGWeb. As for the examples linked to from that page, there's
                      no good reason to refer to the SVG DTD. Who knows why that have <code>standalone="no"</code> in the XML declaration when the document
                      has no external references. Putting <code>version="1.1"</code> on the root is kinda useless too.

                      happened to know how to write filters (because that list of elements sure doesn't help you): an element can have only one filter,
                      but that filter might use multiple filter primitives to define its effect. The three lighting elements <code>feDistantLight</code>,
                      <code>fePointLight</code> and <code>feSpotLight</code> aren't even filters primitives -- they're just helper elements for the two
                      lighting primitives <code>feDiffuseLighting</code> and <code>feSpecularLighting</code>.

                      The sentence talking about the id attribute on the <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> is confused. <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> need not be nested

          <hr><p>I don't think \u0076\u0061\u0072 actually counts as "var" in that context &mdash;sephr</p>
          <p>^-- It does [does as in I'm right or wrong?] -- as in, \u0076\u0061\u0072 is an invalid identifier ;) [ah ok, what about function::var then? ;)] Mozilla extension? e4x? [yes, but using a namespace from mozilla <a href="">(@mozilla.org/js/function)]</a> ok! [it's sorta the "default" namespace of every property <a href="">x="@mozilla.org/js/function"; document.x::title</a> === document.title; though also an empty namespace works too (x=""), but that won't work for direct variables (x::y as opposed to z.x::y) I think maybe this is a bug; oh, and don't get me started with the weird hacks you can get by combining destructuring assignment in arguments, escape sequences, eval, and the function:: namespace (all together); you can do crazy shit with the context]</p>
          <p>[not really an extension when only mozilla implements JS]. See 7.6 where it clearly states that escape sequences should not constitute reserved words if they were to be replaced with their actual values (see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2F770357&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaqylbLMI_abIazzl9FZoXxt3PFQ">https://gist.github.com/770357</a>). --kangax</p>
