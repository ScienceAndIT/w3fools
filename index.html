        A few of us JavaScript developers have been collecting cases where w3schools.com contains inaccurate information or just really
        bad advice. We certainly do not advocate that anyone use w3schools as a reference or place to learn techniques.The Mozilla Docs
        Center (MDC) is much much better<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup>. It is also a wiki (little known fact),
        which means we, as knowledgeable web developers, can add or change information so the pages are as effective as possible.

      <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          W3Schools.com is absolutely not affiliated with the W3C. In fact the W3C has asked them to disavow any connection by explicitly
          stating they are unrelated. W3Schools refused. (src?)
        </li>

        <li>
          W3Schools publishes inaccurate, misleading, and confusing content. Just scroll down this page. We dare you.
          <sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup>
        </li>

        <li>
          W3Schools sell their certificates (for $95), which actually have no value, because they're not affiliated with any
          educational organizations/institutions. (src?)
        </li>    
      </ol>

      <p>We believe w3schools is harmful to the web. Web developers deserve better.</p>

      <!--
      <something about putting ‘mdc’ in your search query>
      To filter out w3school in your google search, append “-w3school” to your search without the quotes. To get the document from MDC,
      just append mdc to your search query.

      On recommendations.. htmldog for beginner html/css, MDC for intermediate css and javascript, i think.
      -->

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          More people to know they have <em>NO RELATION</em> to W3C. New users know w3schools is not
          official and their certificates are not valid (a lot of them with not enough grasp of English
          purchase these certificates which are not that cheap). Make sure it does not land in any top
          results for searches on writing good markup, style and script.
        </li>

        <li>
          Better cognizance that w3schools is riddled with bad information. We urge everyone, not just web
          developers, to stop linking/reference w3schools.
          <sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup>
        </li>

        <li>
          Along with promoteJS, sharing the fact that MDC is the <em>best</em> resource for JavaScript and
          CSS. For HTML, we should from now on use 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Learn">www.w3.org/html/wiki/Learn</a>, see also
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements">www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements</a>.
          <sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup>
        </li>

        <li>
          W3schools to consider <i>wikifying/github</i>-ing their content
          <sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup> so community will self correct and keep the information
          up-to-date. Today, they do not even allow you to submit corrections on a page.
        </li>

        <li>
          Also.. While I hate to say it.. Let’s stay as constructive as possible&hellip;
          The feedback in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2082089">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2082089</a>
          totalllllly bummed me out, but it also helped me to understand how best to
          position this site. e.g. We can’t call for the death of w3schools.. but
          we’re demanding some improvments, highlighting their faults, and
          recommending alterntatives. ~paul (sat morning)
          <ul>
            <li>The page is good at illustrating their faults..</li>
            <li>We should explain why *it matters* (bad education hurts you and everyone else. it costs employers money. etc)</li>
            <li>and what the internet should do about it (and keep in mind what noobs can/should do now)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

                <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are called "methods," rather than objects that implement the HTML5

                This is a bullshit page. Why? you <strong>never</strong> pass a string to <code>setTimeout()</code> unless you like using
                <code>eval()</code>. Doing this also means you can't use any variables from your local scope. Also, the examples on this page

              <p>
                Also abysmal. <code>document.write()</code> has a tendency to trash a page and is one of the poorest ways possible to add content. It
                also means that you can't defer/asynchronously load a script and your DOM loading is delayed because the browser has to wait
                for your <code>document.write()</code>. Oh, and by the way, user-agent sniffing is a <em>very</em> bad thing. So is sniffing just
                about any parts of the <code>window.navigator</code> object.

                Apparently <em>declarations</em> and <em>expressions</em> can go right to hell (since JavaScript only is a sequence of statements),

                Technically&hellip; JavaScript is a trademark originally registered by Sun Microsystems and licensed to Netscape when the language
                was new. Sun was acquired by Oracle, which now owns the trademark, and Netscape passed the license for the trademark on to Mozilla.
                The language was eventually standardized under the creative name ECMAScript by the EMCA international standards organization to
                avoid legal conflicts with the trademark owner. Similarly, Microsoft named its clone of JavaScript, JScript. Meanwhile, JavaScriptCore,
                the implementation of ECMAScript in Apple's Safari, appears to be willing to take the chance, and Google's v8 is off
                doing its own thing being awesome and breaking the mold, man. Also, JavaScript is a subset (or superset depending upon which version
                of JS you are describing) of ECMAScript

                Assigning an <code>RegExp</code> object to a variable named <code>txt</code> is quite confusing. Also, weren't octals removed for
                escape sequences in ES5? Also also, no mention of non-capturing submatches.

                It lists <code>new Array()</code> as the way to create an array. The problem is that this is the old way (not a big deal)

                It's bad advice to suggest using the Adobe SVG Viewer for browser that don't support SVG.

As for the examples linked to from that page, there's no good reason to refer to the SVG DTD. Who knows why that have standalone="no" in the XML declaration when the document has no external references. Putting version="1.1" on the root is kinda useless too.

The three lighting elements feDistantLight, fePointLight and feSpotLight aren't even filters primitives -- they're just helper elements for the two lighting primitives feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting.

      <h3>FWIW - their (dis)connection to W3C</h3>
      <p>- I've (Paul Irish) talked to the W3C to ask them to disavow a connection (since everyone thinks they are related) </p>
      <p> &nbsp;- W3C has asked them, in fact.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;- they are not interested in stating for a fact that they are not connected to the W3C </p>
      <p> &nbsp;- so that's kinda the end of that.</p>
      <p>Is it? Deceptive business practices are illegal, even in Norway (where Refsnes Data, the owner of w3schools reside).</p>

      <h3>Design Notes</h3>
      <p>should we break this into sections? html, css, js, jquery, etc.<sup><a href="#cmnt26" id="cmnt_ref26">[z]</a></sup></p>
      <p>We might get some basic PageRank out of this so maybe we'll do some promoteJS style linking to MDC. e.g. for like the word "Array" and shit we'll just link straight to MDC for all that. &nbsp;Boomboom.</p>
      <p>It'd be fun to keep the ever-so-fun language of this document. </p>
      <p>Re-writing this would delete all we did.</p>
      <p>Yah. "Below is some aggregate research and notes from the collective JavaScript community. Mature language. You've been warned&hellip;" might do the trick.</p>
      <p>It will, this document indeed gives its best for its language.</p>
      <p>Keep the hyperlinks to w3schools just like they are here.. never using anchor text.. but linked. (with rel=nofollow <sup><a href="#cmnt27" id="cmnt_ref27">[aa]</a></sup>) because we DONT want them getting any SEO benefit out of this. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fw3schools.com%2Fabout%2Fabout_copyright.asp&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcWAQFwDjrwjMWTovdPAwmXgsKYA">http://w3schools.com/about/about_copyright.asp</a> says "Pages, code or other content from W3Schools may not be redistributed or reproduced in any way, shape, or form without the written permission of Refsnes Data."

      <hr><p>I JUST WANTED TO SAY before you deleted it anyway that it does not really "control the length"&mdash;it's not like a Java array where it's bound to a particular length when you do that.</p>
