          <h2>W3Schools is trouble</h2>
          <ol>
            <li class="noaffiliation">
              W3Schools.com is <strong>not affiliated with the W3C</strong>. In fact the W3C has asked them to disavow any connection by explicitly
              stating they are unrelated. W3Schools refused. <!-- This fact is from conversations with W3C employees, but afaik it is not published publicly on he web. -->
            </li>

            <li class="cert">
              W3Schools <a href="w3schools.com/cert/default.asp">sell their certificates</a> (for $95), which actually have no value, because they're not affiliated with any
              educational organizations/institutions nor do they develop the languages, standards they sell the certifications for. 
            </li>
            <li class="incorrect">
              W3Schools publishes inaccurate, misleading, and confusing content. Just scroll down this page. We dare you.
              <sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup>
            </li>  
          </ol>

          <p>We believe w3schools is harmful to the web. Web developers deserve better.</p>


          <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
          
          <h4>Bad education hurts.</h4>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Being educated poorly hampers your ability to score a good job.
            <li>Inaccurate references slow development and cause costly QA loops.
            <li>Learning key web development idioms slowly or wrongly puts you years behind your own colleagues.
              
          </ol>
          <!--
          <something about putting ‘mdc’ in your search query>
          To filter out w3school in your google search, append “-w3school” to your search without the quotes. To get the document from MDC,
          just append mdc to your search query.

          On recommendations.. htmldog for beginner html/css, MDC for intermediate css and javascript, i think.
          -->

          <h2>What should be done</h2>
          <ol>

            <li>Learn from reputable sources.
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://htmldog.com/">HTML Dog</a> is a fantastic and comprehensive intro for HTML and CSS.
                <li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/#toc">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a> covers the basics of web standards-based design in HTML and CSS.
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs">The MDC (Mozilla's Doc Center)</a> takes over at intermediate CSS and covers JavaScript better than anyone.
                  <ul>
                    <li>The MDC is also a wiki (little known fact),
                    which means we, as knowledgeable web developers, can add or change information so the pages are as effective 
                  </ul>
                <li>The W3C has a wiki-based general <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Learn">Learn</a> page as well as an 
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements">HTML element reference</a>.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
              Until they fix their content, we urge everyone, not just web
              developers, to stop linking to or referencing w3schools.
              <sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup>
            </li> -->

            <li>
              W3schools should consider <abbr title="make the site a wiki. Or.. put it all in public source control, like on Github.">wikifying</abbr> their content so the community would self correct and keep the information
              up-to-date. Today, they do not even allow you to submit corrections on a page. They should.

                      <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are called "methods," rather than objects that implement the HTML5

                      One of many examples. Code does not use the <code>var</code> keyword. They don't explain the difference between using and not
                      using the keyword; <code>var</code> should always be used.

                      has a ton of global variables.

                      Also abysmal. <code>document.write()</code> has a tendency to trash a page and is one of the poorest ways possible to add content. It
                      also means that you can't defer/asynchronously load a script and your DOM loading is delayed because the browser has to wait
                      for your <code>document.write()</code>. Oh, and by the way, user-agent sniffing is a <em>very</em> bad thing. So is sniffing just
                      about any parts of the <code>window.navigator</code> object.

                      Technically&hellip; JavaScript is a trademark originally registered by Sun Microsystems and licensed to Netscape when the language
                      was new. Sun was acquired by Oracle, which now owns the trademark, and Netscape passed the license for the trademark on to Mozilla.
                      The language was eventually standardized under the creative name ECMAScript by the EMCA international standards organization to
                      avoid legal conflicts with the trademark owner. Similarly, Microsoft named its clone of JavaScript, JScript. Meanwhile, JavaScriptCore,
                      the implementation of ECMAScript in Apple's Safari, appears to be willing to take the chance, and Google's v8 is off
                      doing its own thing being awesome and breaking the mold, man. Also, JavaScript is a subset (or superset depending upon which version

                      It's bad advice to suggest using the Adobe SVG Viewer for browser that don't support SVG. It's unmaintained and I think it doesn't even work on Windows 7. &nbsp;Better is to suggest the use of SVGWeb. As for the examples linked to from that page, there's no good reason to refer to the SVG DTD. Who knows why that have standalone="no" in the XML declaration when the document has no external references. Putting version="1.1" on the root is kinda useless too.

                      What an exceptionally useful page&hellip; The "tip" that you can use multiple filters on an element is kind of misleading, if you happened to know how to write filters (because that list of elements sure doesn't help you): an element can have only one filter, but that filter might use multiple filter primitives to define its effect. The three lighting elements feDistantLight, fePointLight and feSpotLight aren't even filters primitives -- they're just helper elements for the two lighting primitives feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting.

                    <p>
                      The sentence talking about the id attribute on the &lt;filter&gt; is confused. &lt;filter&gt; need not be nested in a &lt;defs&gt;. The description of &lt;defs&gt; is pretty weak.
